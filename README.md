# AeroTrack

## 🏷 Tagline

## 💡 Inspiration

Aerospace engineering is a complex and highly technical discipline. It requires a lot of knowledge and experience about different aerospace components and systems. And is hard to learn about various aircrafts by just learning the books.

## 💻 What it does

AeroTrack is a web app, which helps you learn about aerospace components and systems. AeroTrack is an AR-based web platform where students come across and learn about various aircraft and spacecraft with the help of interactive 3D Models and AR.

## 📺 Demo video

Check out the complete demo video [here]().

## 🚀 Main Features

- Interactive 3D Models
- Click on the different parts of the 3D Model and get information about different parts
- Learn with Augmented Reality

## 💻 Tech Stack

- Next Js
- TypeScript
- React-three-fiber
- echo3D
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion

## 🤝 Credits

- AR: [echo3D](https://www.echo3d.co/)
- 3D Models: [sketchfab.com](https://sketchfab.com)

## Prerequisites

Required to install and run the software:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge was to render the 3D model, animate the 3D model, and add AR functionality to them, which we overcame using three js and echo3D.
